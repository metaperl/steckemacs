;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs configuration that tries to fetch everything necessary from
;; ELPA, Marmelade and MELPA on startup. Instead of splitting
;; everything up I try to keep everything in one file. My theme called
;; `grandshell` is loaded from MELPA too. The literate configuration
;; is kept in `steckemacs.org' and this file serves only as a way to
;; load that config.

;;; Requirements:

;; Emacs 24.3.50

;;; Code:

(require 'ob-tangle)
(require 'cl)
(package-initialize)

(setq steckemacs-directory (file-name-directory (file-truename load-file-name)))
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "steckemacs.org" steckemacs-directory))

;;; .emacs ends here
